You should have it set up like the state governing and federal governing. You have an umbrella of rules from the 'corporate rules' that all DART buses follow. But You allow the Counties to govern like states so that a driver does not have to get approvals from the headquarters to get help when needed. Like another bus deployed when the original driver is stalled. I've been on routes and heard about incidents such as this. Not cool man. Maybe once the passenger trains reach Sussex and Kent county the changes for the buses will improve. Our state has had the notion of passenger trains coming south of the state for a few decades now. They need to get on that ASAP! Stop pussy-foot'n around. And I'm looking forward to those high speed internet cables being laid down for our children in Sussex County. I know the districts down there have been overlook and underfunded since I was a kid in Junior High at Chipman Middle School! Poor Woodbridge. Also, I am looking for a 'Work from home' job. I'm in debt and awaiting word from the Department of Labor's Overpayment Department concerning whether I have a bill to repay the DOL. I have not gotten an official document from the Wilmington Office in 10 months and even reached out to Secretary Cerron Cade. Nothing in the postal mail yet! I have been sending payments too. I called and asked someone, ""Where are my receipts?"" where's my letter? My storage unit in Dover has most of my personal belongings and I think it went to auction already. I reached out to the IRS to send me my tax information by postal and email and no one replied back with my tax information or forms. Someone has been using my Social Security number and I do know how to request a new one from the SSA government body. I am thinking about filing for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy. I need medical care but don't trust the doctors to be ethical. I don't even think I have medicad anymore. I stay home waiting for these documents. I just turned 37, no kids, bi-sexual, one dog, stay with parents. I get up pray, study Spanish, Italian and German on Duolingo. Either study on 'freeCodeCamp.org' or 'Code Academy' for free to strengthen my coding abilities. I have a Full Stack Java certification but I don't honor it. I was not able to retain much of it, so I secretly decided to reteach myself. I also am studying to earn a management operations diploma. It's hard doing all this. My depression and anxiety don't help. And knowing people are stealing from me too. I need things too. The passenger train will give people jobs. Hopefully to those persons who do not have degrees. There are growing numbers in our state that may never recover economically from the pandemic or the GDP of Delaware. I can only plead the case that the meek are apart of these ambitious plans for 'OUR' future too. Can someone help a citizen out? Ebony Sampson 259 Millchop Lane Magnolia DE 19962 e.m.sampson1@outlook.com I don't want much. I plan on making a tiny home and moving away eventually.

That seems crazy to me and ineffective.  I am also concerned at the lack of connectivity between types of public transportation.  To really make travel effective, there must be integration between all modes of transit.  Will there be bicycle parking and storage added on at the bus station? What about train stations with bicycle parking and long term storage options? Can bicycles be transported on trains? Will there be close proximity between any potential train station and bus station? The previous location of the bus station was less than a block from railways, but now what will be the conduit that connects any future rail service with existing bus services? "
